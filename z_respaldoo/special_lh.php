              <h3>Origin</h3>
              <h5>Limarí Valley</h5>
              The Coastal Range has lost height at this point, leaving the way free for the cold influence of the Pacific Ocean. The soil type is clay loam, poor in organic matter and stoniness variable.</p>
              <br>
              <h6>Viniﬁcation</h6>
              <h3>Week and type of harvesting:</h3> The grapes were hand picked in two stages, the first on March 3 and the second on March 18. The drying processes extended over two weeks for the first part and one week for the second due to the forecast of rain. The grapes were then collected and transported to the winery.
              <h3>Vinification:</h3> During harvesting, a careful selection was made of the pinkest fruit, this being the most fragrant and concentrated. At the same time, the clusters were spread out over a previously prepared surface to allow them to dry slowly in the warm sunshine of the Limarí Valley. Later, in the winery, the must was fermented at very low temperatures (12°C) until it reached optimum levels of sugar and alcohol.
              <h3>Harvesting report:</h3> The Limarí Valley continues to be affected by the drought, although it presented good weather conditions with average temperatures that were similar to those of the previous seasons and an absence of rainfall during the harvest season that resulted in healthy grapes of excellent quality. This season’s drying process was a bit shorter for the second stage, and therefore we obtained a must with pleasing sweetness that is intensely aromatic, fresh, and fruity with juicy acidity and that is very pleasing to drink.
              <br><br>
              <h6>Degustation</h6>
              <h3>Colour:</h3> Yellow with a golden hue.
              <h3>Aroma:</h3> Intense and expressive, with notes of white  owers and dried apricots complemented by the typical and pleasing bouquet that develops with bottle aging.
              <h3>Flavour:</h3> Lush and fresh with the sweet flavors of quince and figs. A pleasingly long and persistent finish, very well balanced by its natural acidity.
              <h3>Serving Temperature:</h3> 8°C.
              <h3>Match Food:</h3> Roquefort cheese, pâté de foie gras, tarts, cheesecake and desserts.
              <h3>Keeping potential:</h3> 3 years.
